# Detach (WIP)
A fork of [spotify-playlist-dl](https://github.com/inmicro/spotify-playlist-dl) rewritten by me for fun and personal use.

### Dependancies
You will require `ffmpeg` to be on your system

### Disclaimer
I do not condone piracy of any type. This is just to *show* what is possible with python and not for personal gain *at all*. Therefore this script is *only* for educational purposes.

### Thanks
To [inmicro](https://github.com/inmicro) for laying the groundwork of this script, show his original repository some love as well!
